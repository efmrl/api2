package api2

// Package api2 defines the REST interface to efmrl.com.
//
// Every efmrl has its own path that can be used for making the REST API calls.
// By default, the path is ".e". So for example, if an efmrl is named "foo",
// then calls could be made to "https://foo.efmrl.com/.e/...", where "..." is
// documented in this package.
